## Okta Schema

> **Note on Schema Introspection**: OktaUser and other Okta nodes do not have formal `CartographyNodeSchema` models and use legacy Cypher query-based ingestion. This means schema introspection APIs may return empty results for Okta nodes. Refer to this documentation for complete schema information including node properties and relationships.

Okta integrates with AWS through SAML federation, allowing Okta users to access AWS resources. The complete relationship path is:

```cypher
(:OktaUser)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)-[:ASSUMED_ROLE_WITH_SAML]->(:AWSRole)
```

**How it works:**
1. **OktaUser to AWSSSOUser**: When Okta is configured as a SAML identity provider for AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO), OktaUsers can assume AWSSSOUser identities. The link is established by matching the `AWSSSOUser.external_id` with the `OktaUser.id`.
2. **AWSSSOUser to AWSRole**: When users actually assume roles through AWS Identity Center, CloudTrail management events record these assumptions as `ASSUMED_ROLE_WITH_SAML` relationships.


### OktaOrganization

Representation of an [Okta Organization](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/).

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `Tenant` to enable cross-platform queries for organizational tenants across different systems (e.g., AWSAccount, AzureTenant, GCPOrganization).

| lastupdated |  Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| id | The name of the Okta Organization, e.g. "lyft" |

    ```
    (OktaOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(OktaUser)
    ```

    ```
    (OktaOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(OktaGroup)

    ```
    (OktaOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(OktaApplication)
    ```

    ```

### OktaUser

| activated | ISO 8601 timestamp when the user was activated |
| status_changed | ISO 8601 timestamp of the last status change |
| last_login | ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's last login |
| okta_last_updated | ISO 8601 timestamp when user properties were last modified in Okta |

#### Relationships

- **OktaOrganization contains OktaUsers**: Every OktaUser belongs to an OktaOrganization
    ```cypher
    (:OktaOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(:OktaUser)
    ```

- **OktaUser is an identity for a Human**: Links Okta identities to Human entities (matched by email)
    ```cypher
    (:Human)-[:IDENTITY_OKTA]->(:OktaUser)
    ```
    This relationship allows tracking the same person across multiple identity systems. The Human node is automatically created based on the OktaUser's email address.

- **OktaUsers are assigned OktaApplications**: Tracks which applications a user has access to
    ```cypher
    (:OktaUser)-[:APPLICATION]->(:OktaApplication)
    ```

- **OktaUser can be a member of OktaGroups**: Group membership for access control
    ```cypher
    (:OktaUser)-[:MEMBER_OF_OKTA_GROUP]->(:OktaGroup)
    ```

- **OktaUser can be a member of OktaAdministrationRoles**: Administrative role assignments
    ```cypher
    (:OktaUser)-[:MEMBER_OF_OKTA_ROLE]->(:OktaAdministrationRole)
    ```

- **OktaUsers can have authentication factors**: Multi-factor authentication methods (SMS, TOTP, WebAuthn, etc.)
    ```cypher
    (:OktaUser)-[:FACTOR]->(:OktaUserFactor)
    ```

- **OktaUsers can assume AWS SSO identities via SAML federation**: Links to AWS Identity Center users
    ```cypher
    (:OktaUser)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```
    This relationship is established when Okta is configured as a SAML identity provider for AWS Identity Center. The link is matched by `AWSSSOUser.external_id == OktaUser.id`.

    Using the generic UserAccount label:
    ```cypher
    (:UserAccount)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```
    See the [Cross-Platform Integration](#cross-platform-integration-okta-to-aws) section above for the complete Okta → AWS access path.
