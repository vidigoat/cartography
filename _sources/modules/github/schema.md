    (GitHubRepository)-[OWNER]->(GitHubOrganization)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories in an organization can have [outside collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#collaboratoraffiliation) who may be granted different levels of access, including ADMIN,
WRITE, MAINTAIN, TRIAGE, and READ ([Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission)).

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[:OUTSIDE_COLLAB_{ACTION}]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories in an organization also mark all [direct collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#collaboratoraffiliation), folks who are not necessarily 'outside' but who are granted access directly to the repository (as opposed to via membership in a team).  They may be granted different levels of access, including ADMIN,
WRITE, MAINTAIN, TRIAGE, and READ ([Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission)).

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[:DIRECT_COLLAB_{ACTION}]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories use ProgrammingLanguages
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:LANGUAGE]->(ProgrammingLanguage)
    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubBranches
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:BRANCH]->(GitHubBranch)
    ```

    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:HAS_RULE]->(GitHubBranchProtectionRule)
    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubRulesets.
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:HAS_RULESET]->(GitHubRuleset)
    ```
- GitHubTeams can have various levels of [access](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission) to GitHubRepositories.

  ```
  (GitHubTeam)-[ADMIN|READ|WRITE|TRIAGE|MAINTAIN]->(GitHubRepository)
  ```

- GitHubRepositories can have CODEOWNERS rules parsed from the effective `CODEOWNERS` file on the default branch.

  ```
  (GitHubRepository)-[:HAS_CODEOWNER_RULE]->(GitHubCodeOwnerRule)
  ```

- GitHubUsers who have committed to GitHubRepositories in the last 30 days are tracked with commit activity data.

  ```
  (GitHubUser)-[:COMMITTED_TO]->(GitHubRepository)
  ```

  This relationship includes the following properties:
  - **commit_count**: Number of commits made by the user to the repository in the last 30 days
  - **last_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's most recent commit to the repository
  - **first_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's oldest commit to the repository within the 30-day period

    ```

- GitHubPersonalAccessTokens are resources under GitHubOrganizations.

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitHubPersonalAccessToken)
    ```

- GitHubUsers relate to GitHubOrganizations in a few ways:
  - Most typically, they are members of an organization.
  - They may also be org admins (aka org owners), with broad permissions over repo and team settings.  In these cases, they will be graphed with two relationships between GitHubUser and GitHubOrganization, both `MEMBER_OF` and `ADMIN_OF`.
  - In some cases there may be a user who is "unaffiliated" with an org, for example if the user is an enterprise owner, but not member of, the org.  [Enterprise owners](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owners) have complete control over the enterprise (i.e. they can manage all enterprise settings, members, and policies) yet may not show up on member lists of the GitHub org.

    ```
    # a typical member
    (GitHubUser)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitHubOrganization)

    # an admin member has two relationships to the org
    (GitHubUser)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitHubOrganization)
    (GitHubUser)-[ADMIN_OF]->(GitHubOrganization)

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitHubTeam)
    ```

- GitHubTeams may be children of other teams:

    ```
    (GitHubTeam)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitHubTeam)
    ```

- GitHubUsers may be ['immediate'](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#teammembershiptype) members of a team (as opposed to being members via membership in a child team), with their membership [role](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#teammemberrole) being MEMBER or MAINTAINER.

    ```

    - **first_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's oldest commit to the repository within the 30-day period


### GitHubPersonalAccessToken

Representation of GitHub personal access token metadata exposed to organization administrators. Fine-grained PATs are retrieved from the [organization personal access tokens API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/personal-access-tokens). Classic PAT metadata is retrieved only when GitHub exposes it through the [SAML SSO credential authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/orgs#list-saml-sso-authorizations-for-an-organization).

Cartography never stores raw PAT values, token prefixes, or token fragments such as `token_last_eight`.

Fine-grained and classic PATs also receive kind-specific labels, `GitHubFineGrainedPersonalAccessToken` and `GitHubClassicPersonalAccessToken`, to support queries that target one kind.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `APIKey` to enable cross-platform queries for long-lived API credentials across different systems.

| token_id | GitHub fine-grained PAT token ID, when returned |
| token_name | Fine-grained PAT name, when returned |
| owner_login | Login of the GitHub user who owns the token |
| repository_selection | Fine-grained PAT repository selection, such as `all` or `selected` |
| permissions | Fine-grained PAT permissions as a JSON string |
| scopes | Classic PAT OAuth scopes exposed by SAML credential authorizations |
| access_granted_at | Native datetime — when fine-grained PAT access was granted to organization resources |
| credential_authorized_at | Native datetime — when a classic PAT was authorized for SAML SSO organization access |
| credential_accessed_at | Native datetime — when the SAML-authorized credential was last accessed (auth events) |
| expires_at | Native datetime — token or credential authorization expiry |
| last_used_at | Native datetime — when the fine-grained PAT was last used to call the GitHub API. Unset for classic PATs, whose SAML endpoint reports auth events under `credential_accessed_at` and not API calls |

#### Relationships

- GitHubPersonalAccessTokens are resources under GitHubOrganizations.

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubPersonalAccessToken)
    ```

- GitHubPersonalAccessTokens are owned by the GitHubUser they authenticate as, when the owner can be resolved.

    ```
    (GitHubPersonalAccessToken)-[:OWNED_BY]->(GitHubUser)

Cartography does not ingest ruleset bypass actors. GitHub documents ruleset bypass actors as permission-limited to callers with write access to the ruleset, and Cartography is expected to run with read-only GitHub permissions. Treat bypass actor data as intentionally unavailable in this schema rather than as an empty bypass list.

| **manifest_file** | Manifest filename (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) |
| version | Exact version if pinned (e.g., `"18.2.0"`). `null` for ranges or unpinned dependencies. |
| type | Package URL type (e.g., `npm`, `pypi`, `maven`). `null` if version is not exact. |
| purl | Package URL (e.g., `"pkg:npm/react@18.2.0"`). `null` if version is not exact. |
| **normalized_id** | Normalized ID for cross-tool matching (format: `{type}\|{namespace/}{name}\|{version}`). Indexed. `null` if version is not exact. |
| source | Provenance of the version: `dependency_graph` from GitHub's dependency graph, or `lockfile` when an exact version was recovered from a lockfile fallback. |
| version_confidence | Confidence in the version: `exact` (an exact version is known), `range` (only a requirement range is known), or `unknown` (no version or requirement). |

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node also carries the extra label `GitHubDependency`. When `normalized_id` is populated (exact version), a canonical `Package` (ontology) node is detected as this dependency, enabling cross-scanner queries alongside Trivy, Syft, SocketDev, and GitLab packages.

> **Lockfile fallback**: GitHub's dependency graph reports some dependencies with only a version range (no exact version), so they have no `normalized_id` and cannot be projected into the Package ontology. For ecosystems with a parseable lockfile (`uv.lock` for pip, `package-lock.json` for npm), the sync fetches the lockfile co-located with the dependency's manifest (e.g. a manifest under `services/api/package.json` uses `services/api/package-lock.json`, never the repo-root lockfile) and, where it pins an exact version for a range-only dependency, fills in `version`, `type`, and `normalized_id` and sets `source` to `lockfile` and `version_confidence` to `exact`. Because a `Dependency` node is shared by `name|requirements` (not by version), if two manifests pin the same `name|requirements` to different exact versions the enrichment is declined for that node to avoid representing the wrong version. Lockfiles are fetched only for manifests that have range-only dependencies in a supported ecosystem.

#### Relationships

- **GitHubRepository** via **REQUIRES** relationship
  - **requirements**: Original requirement string from manifest
  - **manifest_path**: Path to manifest file in repository

    ```
    (GitHubRepository)-[:REQUIRES]->(Dependency)
    ```

- A canonical **Package** (ontology) is detected as a **GitHubDependency**.

    ```
    (Package)-[:DETECTED_AS]->(Dependency:GitHubDependency)
    ```

### GitHubDependabotAlert

#### Relationships

- GitHubDependabotAlerts belong to a GitHubOrganization.

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubDependabotAlert)
    ```

- GitHubDependabotAlerts are found in GitHubRepositories.

    ```
    (GitHubDependabotAlert)-[:FOUND_IN]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubDependabotAlerts may be dismissed by a GitHubUser.

    ```
    (GitHubDependabotAlert)-[:DISMISSED_BY]->(GitHubUser)
    ```

- GitHubDependabotAlerts may be assigned to one or more GitHubUsers.

    ```
    (GitHubDependabotAlert)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(GitHubUser)
    ```

Dependabot package, GHSA, CWE, and reference identifiers are currently stored as properties. Cartography does not create dependency or CVE relationships from this payload until package/dependency identity can be normalized safely across sources. CVE-backed alerts are labeled `CVE` for compatibility with CVE metadata enrichment.

- **DependencyGraphManifest** via **HAS_DEP** relationship
  - Dependencies are linked to their specific manifest files

    ```
    (DependencyGraphManifest)-[:HAS_DEP]->(Dependency)
    ```

Dependency nodes are deliberately shared across organizations and repositories
(the same `name|requirements` id is reused everywhere it appears), so they are
not anchored to a single tenant via a `RESOURCE` edge. Stale Dependency nodes
are cleaned up globally once per sync cycle, alongside other shared GitHub
nodes such as `PythonLibrary`.

### GitHubPackage

Representation of a container package hosted on GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`). Each package is the registry-side container for one or more image tags and their underlying image digests.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `ContainerRegistry` to enable cross-platform queries across registry repositories (e.g., `ECRRepository`, `GitLabContainerRepository`).

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The package `html_url` |
| **name** | Package name |
| **package_type** | Package type as reported by GitHub (typically `container`) |
| visibility | Visibility of the package (`public` or `private`) |
| **uri** | Pullable package URI (without tag or digest) |
| **html_url** | Web URL of the package |
| created_at | Creation timestamp from GitHub |
| updated_at | Last-update timestamp from GitHub |

#### Relationships

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubPackage)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories own GitHubPackages (best-effort; only set when the package payload exposes a repository).

    ```
    (GitHubRepository)-[:HAS_PACKAGE]->(GitHubPackage)
    ```

- GitHubPackages expose container image tags.

    ```
    (GitHubPackage)-[:REPO_IMAGE]->(GitHubContainerImageTag)
    ```

- GitHubPackages expose container images by digest.

    ```
    (GitHubPackage)-[:HAS_IMAGE]->(GitHubContainerImage)
    ```

### GitHubContainerImage

Representation of a container image stored in GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`), identified by its digest. Images are content-addressable and can be referenced by multiple tags. Manifest lists (multi-architecture images) contain references to platform-specific child images.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has conditional extra labels based on the image type: `Image` for single-platform images (`type="image"`), or `ImageManifestList` for multi-architecture manifest lists (`type="manifest_list"`). These labels enable cross-platform queries for container images across different systems (e.g., `ECRImage`, `GCPArtifactRegistryImage`, `GitLabContainerImage`).

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The image digest (e.g., `sha256:abc123...`) |

    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:HEAD]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:TAIL]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    ```

- GitHubContainerImages can point at a parent/base image when SLSA attestation or image history identifies one. The edge carries provenance metadata.

    ```
    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:BUILT_FROM]->(GitHubContainerImage)
    ```

    Relationship properties:
    - **from_attestation**: `true` when the link was derived from a SLSA attestation, `false` for history-based matching
    - **parent_image_uri**: URI of the parent image (when known)
    - **confidence**: Confidence score of the match (0.0 to 1.0)

    (:AzureFunctionApp)-[:HAS_IMAGE]->(:GitHubContainerImage)
    ```

### GitHubContainerImageTag

Representation of a tag inside a GitHub container package. Tags are mutable pointers to a specific image digest. Multiple tags can resolve to the same `GitHubContainerImage` (e.g., `latest` and `v1.0.0`).

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `ImageTag` to enable cross-platform queries for container image tags across different registries.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The fully-qualified tag URI (e.g., `ghcr.io/org/pkg:v1.0.0`) |
| **name** | Tag name (e.g., `v1.0.0`) |
| **uri** | Same as id, the fully-qualified tag URI |
| **digest** | Digest of the image this tag currently resolves to |

    ```
    (GitHubContainerImageTag)-[:IMAGE]->(GitHubContainerImage)
    ```

### GitHubContainerImageLayer

Representation of a container image layer stored in GitHub Container Registry. Layers are the building blocks of container images, identified by their uncompressed content hash (`diff_id`). Multiple images can share the same layers through Docker's layer deduplication.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `ImageLayer` to enable cross-provider queries for container image layers (e.g., `ECRImageLayer`, `GCPArtifactRegistryImageLayer`, `GitLabContainerImageLayer`).

**Note**: Layers are keyed by `diff_id` (uncompressed layer digest from the image config) rather than `digest` (compressed layer digest from the manifest). This ensures consistent cross-provider layer deduplication: the same layer content may have different compressed digests in different registries but will always share the same `diff_id`.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The uncompressed layer diff_id (e.g., `sha256:abc123...`) |
| diff_id | Same as id |
| digest | Compressed layer digest from the manifest (may differ between registries for the same content) |
| media_type | OCI/Docker media type (e.g., `application/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip`) |
| size | Size of the layer in bytes (compressed) |
| is_empty | Whether the layer is empty (no on-disk effect) |
| history | History entry for this layer extracted from the image config |

#### Relationships

- GitHubContainerImageLayers belong to GitHubOrganizations (for cleanup and cross-image deduplication).

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    ```

- GitHubContainerImages are composed of GitHubContainerImageLayers, with `HEAD`/`TAIL` shortcuts to the base and topmost layers.

    ```
    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:HEAD]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    (GitHubContainerImage)-[:TAIL]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    ```

- GitHubContainerImageLayers form a linked list using `NEXT` relationships, allowing traversal of the layer stack from base to topmost. A layer may have multiple `NEXT` pointers when different images branch from it.

    ```
    (GitHubContainerImageLayer)-[:NEXT]->(GitHubContainerImageLayer)
    ```

### GitHubContainerImageAttestation

Representation of a SLSA attestation (build provenance) returned by the GitHub Attestations API for an image pushed to GHCR.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Attestation ID from the GitHub Attestations API |
| bundle_id | Bundle identifier of the attestation |
| **predicate_type** | In-toto predicate type (e.g., `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`) |
| **attests_digest** | Digest of the image this attestation attests to |
| source_uri | Normalized VCS URL extracted from the attestation predicate |
| source_revision | Commit SHA extracted from the attestation predicate |
| source_file | Source definition file extracted from the attestation predicate (e.g., `Dockerfile`) |

#### Relationships

    ```

- GitHubContainerImageAttestations attest to GitHubContainerImages.

    ```
    (GitHubContainerImageAttestation)-[:ATTESTS]->(GitHubContainerImage)
    ```

### Image to GitHubRepository (Cross-module relationship)

Container images (`Image` nodes from any registry: ECR, GitLab, GCP Artifact Registry, etc.) can be linked to the GitHubRepository that contains the Dockerfile used to build them. This relationship is created from provenance metadata or by analyzing Dockerfile content and matching layer commands against image history.

#### Relationships

- Image nodes may be packaged from a GitHubRepository
    ```
    (:Image)-[:PACKAGED_FROM]->(:GitHubRepository)
    ```

    Relationship properties:
    - **match_method**: How the match was determined: `"provenance"` (from SLSA attestation) or `"dockerfile_analysis"` (from command matching)
    - **dockerfile_path**: Path to the Dockerfile in the repository (only for `dockerfile_analysis` method)
    - **confidence**: Confidence score of the match (0.0 to 1.0, only for `dockerfile_analysis` method)
    - **matched_commands**: Number of commands that matched between Dockerfile and image history (only for `dockerfile_analysis` method)
    - **total_commands**: Total number of commands compared (only for `dockerfile_analysis` method)
    - **command_similarity**: Average similarity score of matched commands (only for `dockerfile_analysis` method)

    Note: This relationship uses the generic `Image` semantic label, enabling cross-registry querying across image registries. Registry-specific pullable references can be reached from `ImageTag` nodes through `(:ImageTag)-[:IMAGE]->(:Image)`.

### Dependency::PythonLibrary

Representation of a Python library as listed in a [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files)
or [setup.cfg](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html) file.
Within a setup.cfg file, cartography will load everything from `install_requires`, `setup_requires`, and `extras_require`.

These nodes are also shared globally across repositories. Repository-specific version constraints stay on the `:REQUIRES` relationship via the `specifier` property.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|**id**|The [canonicalized](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/utils/#packaging.utils.canonicalize_name) name of the library. If the library was pinned in a requirements file using the `==` operator, then `id` has the form ``{canonical name}\|{pinned_version}``.|
|name|The [canonicalized](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/utils/#packaging.utils.canonicalize_name) name of the library.|
|version|The exact version of the library. This field is only present if the library was pinned in a requirements file using the `==` operator.|

#### Relationships

- Software on Github repos can import Python libraries by optionally specifying a version number.

    ```
    (GitHubRepository)-[:REQUIRES{specifier}]->(PythonLibrary)
    ```

    - specifier: A string describing this library's version e.g. "<4.0,>=3.0" or "==1.0.2". This field is only present on the `:REQUIRES` edge if the repo's requirements file provided a version pin.

- A Python Dependency is affected by a SemgrepSCAFinding (optional)

    ```
    (:SemgrepSCAFinding)-[:AFFECTS]->(:PythonLibrary)
    ```

    ```

- GitHubWorkflows use GitHubActions.

    ```
    (GitHubWorkflow)-[:USES_ACTION]->(GitHubAction)
    ```

- GitHubWorkflows reference GitHubActionsSecrets (detected via `${{ secrets.NAME }}` patterns in the YAML).

    ```

    ```

- Container images may be packaged by a GitHubWorkflow (derived from SLSA provenance attestations).

    ```
    (:Image)-[:PACKAGED_BY]->(:GitHubWorkflow)
    ```

    Note: This relationship is created when SLSA provenance attestations specify the GitHub Actions workflow that built the container image. The `Image` label is a semantic label applied to container images across registries (ECR, GitLab, etc.).


### GitHubAction

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |

    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubActionsVariable {level: "repository"})
    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubActionsVariable {level: "environment"})
    ```
