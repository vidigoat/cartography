### IntuneCompliancePolicy

| applies_to_all_devices | Whether the policy is assigned to all managed devices |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |

#### Relationships

- Compliance policies belong to a tenant

    ```cypher
    (:IntuneCompliancePolicy)-[:RESOURCE]->(:EntraTenant)
    ```

- Compliance policies are assigned to Entra groups

    ```cypher
    (:IntuneCompliancePolicy)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(:EntraGroup)
    ```

- Compliance policies apply to managed devices (resolved by analysis job)

    ```cypher
    (:IntuneCompliancePolicy)-[:APPLIES_TO]->(:IntuneManagedDevice)
    ```

    The `APPLIES_TO` relationship is not ingested directly from the API — it is computed by the `intune_compliance_policy_device` analysis job using the following logic:

    1. **Group assignment**: If the policy is assigned to an `EntraGroup` via `ASSIGNED_TO`, any `EntraUser` who is a `MEMBER_OF` that group and has `ENROLLED_TO` a managed device receives the policy.

        ```cypher
        (:IntuneCompliancePolicy)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(:EntraGroup)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(:EntraUser)-[:ENROLLED_TO]->(:IntuneManagedDevice)
        ```

    2. **All users**: If `policy.applies_to_all_users = true`, the policy applies to every managed device in the tenant that has at least one enrolled user.

    3. **All devices**: If `policy.applies_to_all_devices = true`, the policy applies to every managed device in the tenant regardless of user enrollment.

    Stale `APPLIES_TO` relationships are deleted at the end of each run, scoped to the current tenant so that edges belonging to other tenants are not affected. Resolution only considers policies and devices refreshed in the current sync so partial Intune permission coverage does not preserve stale policy-to-device links.
