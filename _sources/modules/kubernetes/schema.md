### KubernetesOIDCProvider
Representation of an external OIDC identity provider for a Kubernetes cluster. This node contains the configuration details of how the cluster is set up to trust external identity systems (such as Auth0, Okta, Entra). The ingestion of users/groups from the identity provider is handled by the respective identity provider Cartography module. Then the Kubernetes module creates relationships between those identities and KubernetesUsers and KubernetesGroups.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `IdentityProvider` to enable cross-platform queries for federated identity providers across different systems (e.g., AWSSAMLProvider, KeycloakIdentityProvider).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Identifier for the OIDC Provider derived from cluster name and provider name (e.g. `my-cluster/oidc/auth0-provider`) |
| issuer_url | URL of the OIDC issuer (e.g. `https://company.auth0.com/`) |
| cluster_name | Name of the Kubernetes cluster this provider is associated with |
| k8s_platform | Type of Kubernetes platform managing this OIDC configuration (e.g. `eks` for AWS EKS, `aks` for Azure AKS) |
| client_id | OIDC client ID used for authentication |
| status | Status of the OIDC provider configuration (e.g. `ACTIVE`) |
| name | Name of the OIDC provider configuration |
| arn | AWS ARN of the identity provider configuration (for EKS) |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| **lastupdated** | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |

#### Relationships
- `KubernetesOIDCProvider` belongs to a `KubernetesCluster` (cleanup scope).
    ```
    (:KubernetesCluster)-[:RESOURCE]->(:KubernetesOIDCProvider)
    ```

- `KubernetesOIDCProvider` is trusted by a `KubernetesCluster` (semantic edge,
  preserved alongside the cleanup-oriented `RESOURCE` edge).
    ```
    (:KubernetesCluster)-[:TRUSTS]->(:KubernetesOIDCProvider)
    ```

Note: Identity mapping between external OIDC providers (Okta, Auth0, etc.) and Kubernetes users/groups is handled through direct relationships from the external identity provider nodes to Kubernetes nodes, not through the `KubernetesOIDCProvider` metadata node.
