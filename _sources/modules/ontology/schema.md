:::{note}
In this schema, `squares` represent `Abstract Nodes` and `hexagons` represent `Semantic Labels` (on module nodes).
:::

### Where ontology relationships come from

1. The abstract ontology node schemas (`User`, `Device`, `PublicIP`, `Package`) declare the edges they own to module nodes (e.g. `(:User)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:UserAccount)`).
2. Ontology analysis jobs derive cross-module edges after sync (e.g. `ontology_users_linking.json` builds the `User`/`UserAccount` graph; `resolved_image_analysis.json` connects `Container` and `Function` to a single-platform `Image`).
3. Sync modules wire edges between two ontology-labelled nodes themselves (e.g. ECS adding `(:ECSContainer:Container)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ECSTask:ComputePod)`). For this last source, canonical `(src, dst, label)` triples are encoded as `RelConstraint` entries in [`cartography/models/ontology/constraints.py`](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/models/ontology/constraints.py); a unit test rejects any module rel between those two ontology labels that uses a different name or direction.

### Ontology Properties on Nodes

Cartography's ontology system supports two distinct patterns for organizing and querying data across modules:

#### 1. Abstract Ontology Nodes

Abstract ontology nodes (e.g., `User`, `Device`) are **dedicated nodes created separately** from module-specific nodes. They serve as unified, cross-module representations of entities.

**How it works:**
- Cartography creates new ontology nodes (`:User`, `:Device`) based on mappings from multiple source modules
- These nodes aggregate and normalize data from module-specific nodes
- Relationships link ontology nodes to their source nodes (e.g., `(:User)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:EntraUser)`)

#### 2. Semantic Labels (Extra Labels)

Semantic labels (e.g., `UserAccount`, `APIKey`) are **extra labels added directly** to module-specific nodes. They enable unified querying without creating separate nodes.

**How it works:**
- Module nodes receive an additional label (e.g., `:EntraUser:UserAccount`, `:AnthropicApiKey:APIKey`)
- Ontology mappings add normalized `_ont_*` properties to these nodes
- The `_ont_source` property tracks which module provided the data
- No separate ontology nodes are created; the module node itself carries the semantic label

#### Ontology Properties (`_ont_*`)

When mappings are applied, nodes automatically receive `_ont_*` properties with normalized ontology field values:

- **Cross-module querying**: Use consistent field names across different modules
- **Data normalization**: Access standardized field values regardless of source format
- **Source tracking**: The `_ont_source` property indicates which module provided the data

:::{important}
Semantic-label queries should use the documented `_ont_*` field names directly, for example `_ont_name`, `_ont_region`, or `_ont_source`.
If you still have queries using `_ont_id`, update them to the current field that represents that concept for the semantic label you are querying.
:::

### User

```{note}
User is an abstract ontology node.
```

A user is a person (or agent) who uses a computer or network service.
A user often has one or many user accounts.

```{important}
If field `active` is null, it should not be considered as `true` or `false`, only as unknown.
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | The unique identifier for the user. |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node. |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated. |
| email | User's primary email. |
| username | Login of the user in the main IDP. |
| fullname | User's full name. |
| firstname | User's first name. |
| lastname | User's last name. |
| active | Boolean indicating if the user is active (e.g. disabled in the IDP). |

#### Relationships

- `User` has one or many `UserAccount` (semantic label):
    ```
    (:User)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:UserAccount)
    ```
- `User` can own one or many `Device`:
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:Device)
    ```
  Jamf device emails, CrowdStrike host emails, and provider-native ownership edges are examples of signals Cartography can use to derive this relationship.
- `User` can own one or many `APIKey` (semantic label):
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:APIKey)
    ```

### UserAccount

```{note}
UserAccount is a semantic label.
```

A user account represents an identity on a specific system or service.
Unlike the abstract `User` node, `UserAccount` is a semantic label applied to concrete user nodes from different modules, enabling unified queries across platforms.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_email | User's email address (often used as primary identifier). |
| _ont_username | User's login name or username. |
| _ont_fullname | User's full name. |
| _ont_firstname | User's first name. |
| _ont_lastname | User's last name. |
| _ont_has_mfa | Whether multi-factor authentication is enabled for this account. |
| _ont_inactive | Whether the account is inactive, disabled, suspended, or locked. |
| _ont_lastactivity | Timestamp of the last activity or login for this account. |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |

#### Relationships

- A `User` has one or many `UserAccount`:
    ```
    (:User)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:UserAccount)
    ```


### UserGroup

```{note}
UserGroup is a semantic label.
```

A user group represents a logical grouping of users or resources within a cloud provider or SaaS platform.
Groups are a key part of the identity graph and enable attack path analysis through group membership relationships.
Unlike the abstract `User` node, `UserGroup` is a semantic label applied to concrete group nodes from different modules, enabling unified queries across platforms.

Common group concepts across platforms include:
- **Cloud IAM**: AWS IAM Groups, AWS SSO Groups, OCI Groups, Scaleway Groups
- **Identity Providers**: Entra Groups, Okta Groups, Keycloak Groups, Google Workspace Groups, GSuite Groups
- **Collaboration**: GitHub Teams, GitLab Groups, Slack Groups, PagerDuty Teams
- **Network/Device**: Duo Groups, Tailscale Groups

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | Display name of the group (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_description | Description of the group. |
| _ont_email | Email address associated with the group (for mail-enabled groups). |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |

#### Relationships

- A `UserAccount` or `ServiceAccount` is a member of a `UserGroup` via the canonical `MEMBER_OF` edge. Groups also nest into other groups with the same edge:
    ```
    (:UserAccount)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(:UserGroup)
    (:ServiceAccount)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(:UserGroup)
    (:UserGroup)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(:UserGroup)
    ```
  Group "owner", "maintainer", and "admin" roles are kept as their own provider-specific edges (a distinct, more privileged semantic), as are transitive `INHERITED_MEMBER_OF` edges derived across nested groups.


### Device

```{note}
Device is an abstract ontology node.
```

A client computer is a host that accesses a service made available by a server or a third party provider.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | The unique identifier for the device. |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node. |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated. |
| hostname | Hostname of the device. |
| instance_id | Provider-specific instance identifier when available. |
| manufacturer | Device manufacturer. |
| os | OS running on the device. |
| os_version | Version of the OS running on the device. |
| model | Device model (e.g. ThinkPad Carbon X1 G11) |
| platform | Platform or device family reported by the source (e.g. `macOS`, `ios`). |
| serial_number | Device serial number. |

#### Relationships

- `Device` is linked to one or many nodes that implements the notion into a module
    ```
    (:User)-[:HAS_REPRESENTATION]->(:*)
    ```
- `User` can own one or many `Device`
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:Device)
    ```
  This relationship may be derived from provider signals such as Jamf device emails, CrowdStrike host emails, or native provider ownership edges.
- A `Device` can be affected by one or many findings (propagated from the provider host/agent during the ontology linking job):
    ```
    (:S1AppFinding)-[:AFFECTS]->(:Device)
    (:CrowdstrikeFinding)-[:AFFECTS]->(:Device)
    ```


### APIKey

```{note}
APIKey is a semantic label.
```

An API key (or access key) is a credential used for programmatic access to services and APIs.
API keys are used across different cloud providers and SaaS platforms for authentication and authorization.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | A human-readable name or description for the API key. |
| _ont_created_at | Timestamp when the API key was created. |
| _ont_updated_at | Timestamp when the API key was last updated. |
| _ont_expires_at | Timestamp when the API key expires (if applicable). |
| _ont_last_used_at | Timestamp when the API key was last used. |


#### Relationships

- An `APIKey` is owned by the `UserAccount` or `ServiceAccount` it authenticates as, via the canonical `OWNED_BY` edge:
    ```
    (:APIKey)-[:OWNED_BY]->(:UserAccount)
    (:APIKey)-[:OWNED_BY]->(:ServiceAccount)
    ```

- At the abstract layer, a `User` owns one or many `APIKey` (derived from the `OWNED_BY` edges above during the ontology linking job):
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:APIKey)
    ```


### Secret

```{note}
Secret is a semantic label.
```

A secret represents sensitive data stored in a secrets management service across different cloud providers and platforms.
Secrets can include database credentials, API keys, certificates, and other sensitive configuration data.
They are managed by dedicated services like AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, GitHub Actions Secrets, and Kubernetes Secrets.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name or identifier of the secret (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_created_at | Timestamp when the secret was created. |
| _ont_updated_at | Timestamp when the secret was last updated. |
| _ont_rotation_enabled | Whether automatic rotation is enabled for the secret. |

#### Relationships

- A `ComputePod`, `Function`, or `ComputeInstance` that consumes a secret is linked via the canonical `USES_SECRET` edge. The injection method is captured on the edge as the `mount_method` property (e.g. `volume`, `env`):
    ```
    (:ComputePod)-[:USES_SECRET]->(:Secret)
    (:Function)-[:USES_SECRET]->(:Secret)
    (:ComputeInstance)-[:USES_SECRET]->(:Secret)
    ```


### EncryptionKey

```{note}
EncryptionKey is a semantic label.
```

An encryption key represents a cryptographic key managed by a cloud key management service.
It generalizes concepts like AWS KMS Keys, GCP Cloud KMS CryptoKeys, and Azure Key Vault Keys.
Encryption keys are used for data encryption, signing, and other cryptographic operations.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name or identifier of the encryption key (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_key_type | The key purpose or usage type (e.g., "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT", "SIGN_VERIFY"). |
| _ont_enabled | Whether the encryption key is currently enabled. |
| _ont_rotation_enabled | Whether automatic key rotation is configured. |

#### Relationships

- A `Secret`, `Database`, `ObjectStorage`, or `FileStorage` encrypted with a customer-managed key is linked to it via the canonical `ENCRYPTED_BY` edge:
    ```
    (:Secret)-[:ENCRYPTED_BY]->(:EncryptionKey)
    (:Database)-[:ENCRYPTED_BY]->(:EncryptionKey)
    (:ObjectStorage)-[:ENCRYPTED_BY]->(:EncryptionKey)
    (:FileStorage)-[:ENCRYPTED_BY]->(:EncryptionKey)
    ```


### ComputeInstance

```{note}
ComputeInstance is a semantic label.
```

A compute instance represents a virtual machine or server instance running in a cloud environment.
It generalizes concepts like EC2 Instances, DigitalOcean Droplets, and Scaleway Instances.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name of the instance. |
| _ont_region | The region or zone where the instance is located. |
| _ont_public_ip_address | The public IP address of the instance. |
| _ont_private_ip_address | The private IP address of the instance. |
| _ont_state | The current state of the instance (e.g., running, stopped). |
| _ont_type | The type or size of the instance (e.g., t2.micro, s-1vcpu-1gb). |
| _ont_created_at | Timestamp when the instance was created. |


### Container

```{note}
Container is a semantic label.
```

A container represents a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.
It generalizes concepts like ECS Containers, Kubernetes Containers, individual containers within Azure Container Groups (`AzureContainerInstance`), and individual containers within GCP Cloud Run Services (`GCPCloudRunServiceContainer`) and Jobs (`GCPCloudRunJobContainer`).

```{note}
GCP Cloud Run Services, Jobs and Revisions are themselves **not** modeled as `Container` (and no longer as `Function` either). Services and Jobs are orchestrators (analogous to `ECSService` / AWS Batch); Revisions are pure versioning markers for Services. Their per-container specs are materialized as child `GCPCloudRunServiceContainer` / `GCPCloudRunJobContainer` nodes that carry `:Container` and `RESOLVED_IMAGE`.
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name of the container. |
| _ont_image | The container image (e.g., nginx:latest). |
| _ont_image_digest | The digest/SHA256 of the container image. |
| _ont_state | The current state of the container (e.g., running, stopped, waiting). |
| _ont_cpu | CPU allocated to the container. |
| _ont_memory | Memory allocated to the container (in MB). |
| _ont_region | The region or zone where the container is running. |
| _ont_namespace | Namespace for logical isolation (e.g., Kubernetes namespace). |
| _ont_health_status | The health status of the container. |

#### Relationships

- `Container` references the image it was asked to run via `HAS_IMAGE` (created at ingest time by matching container runtime digest to image digest). The target may be either a single-platform `Image` or an `ImageManifestList`:
    ```
    (:Container)-[:HAS_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    (:Container)-[:HAS_IMAGE]->(:ImageManifestList)
    ```
- `Container` is connected to a concrete single platform `Image` that actually ran via `RESOLVED_IMAGE`. This edge is produced by the `resolved_image_analysis.json` analysis job, which runs after the ontology stage. It is only created when the target can be deterministically identified:
    - When `HAS_IMAGE` already points at an `:Image` (not `:ImageManifestList`), `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created directly.
    - When `HAS_IMAGE` points at an `:ImageManifestList`, `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created to the child `:Image` reached via `CONTAINS_IMAGE` whose architecture matches the container's `architecture_normalized`. If zero or more than one child match, no edge is created (determinism guard).
    ```
    (:Container)-[:RESOLVED_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```
- `Container` points at its parent in the unified workload chain. Depending on the provider this is a `ComputePod` (cluster-backed providers like AWS ECS and Kubernetes) or directly a `ComputeService` (serverless providers like GCP Cloud Run).
    ```
    (:Container)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputePod)
    (:Container)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeService)
    ```


### ComputeCluster

```{note}
ComputeCluster is a semantic label.
```

A compute cluster represents a managed container orchestration or data processing environment across cloud providers.
It generalizes concepts like AWS EKS clusters, AWS ECS clusters, AWS EMR clusters, Azure Kubernetes Service clusters, GCP GKE clusters, and native Kubernetes clusters.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name of the cluster. |
| _ont_region | The region or location where the cluster is deployed. |
| _ont_version | The version of the cluster engine (e.g., Kubernetes version, EMR release label). |
| _ont_endpoint | The API endpoint or FQDN for the cluster. |
| _ont_status | The current status of the cluster (e.g., ACTIVE, RUNNING, Succeeded). |
| _ont_control_plane_public_access | True when the cluster's control plane API server is reachable from the public internet. Populated for EKS, GKE, and AKS; left unset for self-managed Kubernetes clusters and for cluster types without a control-plane concept (ECS, EMR). |

#### Relationships

- `ComputeCluster` is the top of the unified workload chain. Children point at it via `WORKLOAD_PARENT`:
    ```
    (:ComputeService)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeCluster)
    (:ComputeNamespace)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeCluster)
    (:ComputePod)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeCluster)
    ```


### ComputeService

```{note}
ComputeService is a semantic label.
```

A compute service represents an orchestrator that schedules, scales, and manages a set of workloads.
It generalizes concepts like AWS ECS services and GCP Cloud Run services and jobs.

`ComputeService` participates in the unified workload chain as the parent of workload nodes. Its position depends on the provider: in cluster-backed providers (AWS ECS) it sits between `ComputeCluster` and `ComputePod`, while in serverless providers like GCP Cloud Run it is the top-of-chain terminus reached directly by `:Container` nodes.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The display name of the service / orchestrator. |
| _ont_region | The region or location where the service is deployed. |
| _ont_status | Current provisioning or operational status of the service (when available from the provider). |

#### Relationships

- `ComputeService` points at its parent `ComputeCluster` when one exists (AWS ECS).
    ```
    (:ComputeService)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeCluster)
    ```
- A workload (`ComputePod` or, in serverless providers, `:Container` directly) points at its parent `ComputeService`.
    ```
    (:ComputePod)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeService)
    (:Container)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeService)
    ```


### ComputeNamespace

```{note}
ComputeNamespace is a semantic label.
```

A compute namespace represents a workload-isolation scope within a `ComputeCluster`.
Today it generalizes the Kubernetes Namespace concept; other providers may join when an analogous scope is modeled.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The display name of the namespace. |
| _ont_status | Current lifecycle phase of the namespace (e.g., `Active`, `Terminating`). |

#### Relationships

- `ComputeNamespace` points at its parent `ComputeCluster`.
    ```
    (:ComputeNamespace)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeCluster)
    ```
- A `ComputePod` in a namespaced provider points at its enclosing `ComputeNamespace`.
    ```
    (:ComputePod)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeNamespace)
    ```


### ComputePod

```{note}
ComputePod is a semantic label.
```

A compute pod represents the smallest schedulable workload unit on a compute platform: a co-scheduled, co-located group of containers sharing network and storage.
It generalizes concepts like Kubernetes Pods, AWS ECS Tasks, and Azure Container Instance container groups.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The display name of the pod / task (when the provider exposes one). |
| _ont_status | Current runtime status of the pod / task (e.g., `Running`, `Pending`). |
| _ont_namespace | Namespace the pod runs in (Kubernetes only). |
| _ont_node | Node or host the pod is scheduled on (Kubernetes only). |

#### Relationships

- A `:Container` points at its parent `ComputePod` in cluster-backed providers (AWS ECS, Kubernetes).
    ```
    (:Container)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputePod)
    ```
- `ComputePod` points at its parent in the unified workload chain. Depending on the provider this is a `ComputeService` (ECS task attached to a service), a `ComputeNamespace` (Kubernetes pod), or directly a `ComputeCluster` (standalone ECS task). In serverless providers like Azure Container Instances, the pod is the top-of-chain terminus and has no `WORKLOAD_PARENT` outgoing.
    ```
    (:ComputePod)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeService)
    (:ComputePod)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeNamespace)
    (:ComputePod)-[:WORKLOAD_PARENT]->(:ComputeCluster)
    ```


### ThirdPartyApp

```{note}
ThirdPartyApp is a semantic label.
```

An OAuth application (or OAuth client) represents a third-party application that has been authorized to access user data via OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML protocols.
OAuth apps span across identity providers (Google Workspace, Okta, Entra, Keycloak) and represent potential security risks when users grant excessive permissions.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_client_id | The OAuth client ID - unique identifier for the application (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_name | Human-readable display name of the OAuth application (REQUIRED). |

| _ont_native_app | Whether this is a native/mobile application (vs web application). |
| _ont_protocol | The authentication protocol used (e.g., oauth2, openid-connect, saml). |
| _ont_source | Source module of the data (e.g., googleworkspace, keycloak, entra, okta). |


#### Relationships

- `User` can authorize `ThirdPartyApp` (for modules that track user-level OAuth authorizations):
    ```
    (:User)-[:AUTHORIZED]->(:ThirdPartyApp)
    ```


### DNSZone

```{note}
DNSZone is a semantic label.
```

A DNS zone represents a managed DNS zone across different cloud providers and DNS services.
It generalizes concepts like AWS Route 53 Hosted Zones, GCP Cloud DNS Zones, and Cloudflare Zones.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The DNS zone name or domain (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_public | Whether the zone is publicly accessible (boolean). |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |


### Database

```{note}
Database is a semantic label.
```

A database represents a managed data storage system across different cloud providers and database technologies.
It generalizes concepts like AWS RDS instances/clusters, DynamoDB tables, Azure SQL databases, Azure CosmosDB databases, and GCP Bigtable instances.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_db_name | The name/identifier of the database (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_db_type | The database engine/type (e.g., "mysql", "postgres", "dynamodb", "mongodb", "cassandra", "cosmosdb-sql", "bigtable"). |
| _ont_db_version | The database engine version. |
| _ont_db_endpoint | The connection endpoint/address for the database. |

### AIModel

```{note}
AIModel is a semantic label.
```

An AI/ML model represents a deployed or referenced foundation, custom, or fine-tuned model across cloud providers and AI bills of materials.
It generalizes concepts like AWS Bedrock foundation and custom models, AWS SageMaker models, GCP Vertex AI models, and AIBOM-detected model components.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | Name or identifier of the model (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_provider | Vendor of the model (e.g. "Anthropic", "Amazon", "Meta") when known, otherwise the cloud provider hosting the model (e.g. "aws", "gcp"), or the framework reporting the model for AIBOM components. |
| _ont_status | Lifecycle or operational status of the model (when exposed by the source). |
| _ont_type | One of "foundation", "custom", or "fine-tuned" (when determinable). |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |


### PermissionRole

```{note}
PermissionRole is a semantic label.
```

A permission role represents an IAM role or permission role that can be assumed by principals across different cloud providers and identity platforms.
It generalizes concepts like AWS IAM Roles, AWS Permission Sets, Azure Role Definitions, GCP IAM Roles, Keycloak Roles, Kubernetes Roles/ClusterRoles, Cloudflare Roles, and OCI Policies.

Common role concepts across platforms include:
- **Cloud IAM**: AWS IAM Roles, AWS Permission Sets, Azure Role Definitions, GCP IAM Roles, OCI Policies
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes Roles, Kubernetes ClusterRoles
- **Identity Providers**: Keycloak Roles
- **SaaS Platforms**: Cloudflare Roles

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | Display name of the role (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_type | Whether the role is builtin or custom (e.g., "builtin", "custom"). |
| _ont_scope | The scope level of the role (e.g., "global", "account", "org", "project", "namespace", "cluster"). |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |

A `UserAccount`, `ServiceAccount`, or `UserGroup` that is granted a permission role is linked via the canonical `HAS_ROLE` edge. Members inherit the roles granted to their groups:
```
(:UserAccount)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:PermissionRole)
(:ServiceAccount)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:PermissionRole)
(:UserGroup)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:PermissionRole)
```

A composite or hierarchical role includes other roles via the canonical `INCLUDES` edge (e.g. Keycloak composite roles):
```
(:PermissionRole)-[:INCLUDES]->(:PermissionRole)
```

A workload that assumes a permission role to obtain its privileges is linked via the canonical `ASSUMES` edge:
```
(:ComputeInstance)-[:ASSUMES]->(:PermissionRole)
(:Function)-[:ASSUMES]->(:PermissionRole)
```
Wired for both `Function` and `ComputeInstance`:
- `Function`: an AWS Lambda is linked to its execution role (`(:AWSLambda)-[:ASSUMES]->(:AWSRole)`); an Azure Function App is linked to the role definitions assigned to its managed identity (`(:AzureFunctionApp)-[:ASSUMES]->(:AzureRoleDefinition)`).
- `ComputeInstance`: an EC2 instance is linked to the role attached through its instance profile (`(:EC2Instance)-[:ASSUMES]->(:AWSRole)`, assembled from `EC2Instance-[:INSTANCE_PROFILE]->AWSInstanceProfile-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->AWSRole`); an Azure VM is linked to the role definitions assigned to its managed identity (`(:AzureVirtualMachine)-[:ASSUMES]->(:AzureRoleDefinition)`). The AWS analysis-job `STS_ASSUMEROLE_ALLOW` edge is kept as the distinct IAM trust-policy view.

GCP compute (`ComputeInstance -[:ASSUMES]-> GCPRole`) is still pending, as it spans the compute and IAM-policy-binding syncs.


### ObjectStorage

```{note}
ObjectStorage is a semantic label.
```

An object storage represents a managed blob/object storage system across different cloud providers.
It generalizes concepts like AWS S3 buckets, GCP Cloud Storage buckets, and Azure Blob Containers.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name/identifier of the storage bucket/container (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_location | The region/location of the storage. |
| _ont_encrypted | Whether the storage is encrypted. |
| _ont_versioning | Whether versioning is enabled. |
| _ont_public | Whether the storage has public access (not available for all providers). |


### FileStorage

```{note}
FileStorage is a semantic label.
```

A file storage represents a managed network file system or file share across different cloud providers.
It generalizes concepts like AWS EFS and Azure Files shares, as opposed to object storage (S3-like)
or block storage (EBS-like).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name/identifier of the file system/share (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_location | The region/location of the file storage. |
| _ont_encrypted | Whether the storage is encrypted at rest. |


### BlockStorage

```{note}
BlockStorage is a semantic label.
```

A block storage represents a managed block-level volume that can be attached to compute instances.
It generalizes concepts like AWS EBS volumes, Azure managed disks, and Scaleway Instance volumes,
as opposed to object storage (S3-like) or network file storage (EFS-like).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name/identifier of the volume (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_size_gb | The size of the volume in gigabytes. |
| _ont_encrypted | Whether the volume is encrypted at rest. Currently populated for AWS EBS volumes only. Azure managed disks are encrypted at rest by default via Storage Service Encryption (SSE), but cartography does not yet model SSE / disk-encryption-set posture, so the field is left unset. Scaleway block volumes do not expose encryption posture in the API. |
| _ont_region | The region/zone where the volume lives. |
| _ont_state | The lifecycle state of the volume (e.g., `available`, `in-use`). |


### Snapshot

```{note}
Snapshot is a semantic label.
```

A snapshot represents a point-in-time copy of a volume or database. It generalizes AWS EBS/RDS snapshots, Azure snapshots, and Scaleway volume snapshots. Publicly shared snapshots are a known data-exfiltration vector.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name/identifier of the snapshot (REQUIRED). For AWS EBS this is the SnapshotId. |
| _ont_encrypted | Whether the snapshot is encrypted at rest. Populated for AWS EBS/RDS snapshots only. **Absence is not `false`**: it means "unknown / not modeled" for that provider, not "unencrypted". Azure exposes only the legacy Azure Disk Encryption flag (snapshots are encrypted at rest by default via SSE), and Scaleway does not expose encryption posture, so the field is left unset for both. Do not write `coalesce(s._ont_encrypted, false) = false` to find unencrypted snapshots; filter on `s._ont_encrypted = false` instead. |
| _ont_public | Whether the snapshot is publicly shared. Populated for AWS EBS/RDS snapshots only. **Absence is not `false`**: Azure and Scaleway do not expose a public-sharing flag on the snapshot node, so the field is left unset (state unknown, not "private"). |
| _ont_source_id | The source volume (AWS EBS), database instance (AWS RDS) the snapshot was taken from. Not populated for Azure (no source on the node) or Scaleway (the source volume is only linked via the `HAS` relationship). |
| _ont_created_at | When the snapshot was created. Not populated for Azure (no creation timestamp captured). |
| _ont_region | The region/zone where the snapshot lives. |


### IdentityProvider

```{note}
IdentityProvider is a semantic label.
```

An identity provider represents a federated identity source (SAML, OIDC, or vendor-defined)
that other systems trust to authenticate users. It generalizes concepts like AWS IAM SAML
providers, Kubernetes OIDC providers (e.g. on EKS), and Keycloak identity providers.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | Display name of the identity provider (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_protocol | The federation protocol (`SAML`, `OIDC`, or provider-defined). |
| _ont_issuer | The issuer URL or trust identifier. Populated for Kubernetes OIDC providers from `issuer_url`. Not populated for AWS IAM SAML providers (the ARN is the AWS-local resource id, not the SAML issuer / entity ID; the real issuer lives in the SAML metadata XML returned by `GetSAMLProvider`, which is not currently parsed) or Keycloak (issuer URL lives in `config.idpEntityId`, which is not currently stored on the node). |
| _ont_enabled | Whether the provider is currently active. |


### CICDPipeline

```{note}
CICDPipeline is a semantic label.
```

A CI/CD pipeline represents a build, deploy, or infrastructure-as-code pipeline definition
across CI/CD platforms. It generalizes concepts like AWS CodeBuild projects, GitHub Actions
workflows, GitLab `.gitlab-ci.yml` configs, and Spacelift stacks.
This category models pipeline *definitions* only; runtime executions (e.g. workflow runs,
Spacelift runs) and step components (e.g. third-party GitHub Actions referenced inside a
workflow) are intentionally excluded. Data-movement / ETL workflows (e.g. Azure Data
Factory pipelines) are also out of scope.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The display name of the pipeline definition (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_type | The pipeline category, normalized to `build` / `deploy` / `iac`. |
| _ont_status | The lifecycle state of the pipeline (e.g., `active`, `disabled`). |


### Tenant

```{note}
Tenant is a semantic label.
```

A tenant represents the top-level organizational boundary or billing entity within a cloud provider or SaaS platform.
Tenants serve as the root container for all resources, users, and configurations within a given service.
We add a Tenant semantic label to all nodes that have outward 'RESOURCE' relationships.

Common tenant concepts across platforms include:
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS Accounts, Azure Tenants, GCP Organizations/Projects
- **Identity Providers**: Entra Tenants, Okta Organizations, Keycloak Organizations
- **SaaS Platforms**: GitHub Organizations, Anthropic Workspaces, OpenAI Projects, Cloudflare Accounts
- **MDM/Security**: Kandji Tenants, SentinelOne Accounts, LastPass Tenants

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | Display name or friendly name of the tenant/organization (REQUIRED for most modules). |
| _ont_status | Current status/state of the tenant (e.g., active, suspended, archived). |
| _ont_domain | Primary domain name associated with the tenant (for workspace/domain-based services). |


### ServiceAccount

```{note}
ServiceAccount is a semantic label.
```

A service account represents a non-human identity used for automation and inter-service communication.
Unlike user accounts, service accounts are designed for programmatic access and workload identity.

Common service account concepts across platforms include:
- **Cloud Providers**: GCP Service Accounts, AWS Service Principals
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes Service Accounts
- **SaaS Platforms**: OpenAI Service Accounts, Scaleway Applications

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | Display name of the service account (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_email | Email address associated with the service account. |
| _ont_active | Whether the service account is active. |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |

#### Relationships

- A workload runs as (assumes the identity of) a `ServiceAccount` via the canonical `RUNS_AS` edge:
    ```
    (:ComputeInstance)-[:RUNS_AS]->(:ServiceAccount)
    (:ComputePod)-[:RUNS_AS]->(:ServiceAccount)
    (:Function)-[:RUNS_AS]->(:ServiceAccount)
    (:ComputeService)-[:RUNS_AS]->(:ServiceAccount)
    ```


### Certificate

```{note}
Certificate is a semantic label.
```

A certificate represents a managed TLS/SSL certificate used for securing communications.
It generalizes concepts like AWS ACM Certificates, AWS IAM Server Certificates, and Azure Key Vault Certificates.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_domain | Domain name or certificate name (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_expiry | Expiration date/time of the certificate. |
| _ont_issuer | Certificate issuer. |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |


### Function

```{note}
Function is a semantic label.
```

A function represents a serverless compute unit that runs code or containers in response to events without managing servers.
It generalizes concepts like AWS Lambda functions, GCP Cloud Functions, and Azure Function Apps. GCP Cloud Run Services and Jobs are orchestrators (not functions) — see the note in the Relationships section below.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name of the function (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_runtime | The runtime environment (e.g., python3.9, nodejs18.x, dotnet6). Only applicable for code-based functions. |
| _ont_memory | Memory allocated to the function (in MB). |
| _ont_timeout | Timeout for function execution (in seconds). |
| _ont_deployment_type | The deployment type: `code` for source-code functions, `container` for container-image functions. Derived per-provider: AWS Lambda maps `PackageType` (`Zip`→`code`, `Image`→`container`); Azure Function App maps `is_container`; GCP Cloud Functions are always `code`. |
| _ont_image | The container image reference (populated when the function is container-deployed: Lambda `PackageType=Image`, Azure Function App with `DOCKER|...`). |
| _ont_image_digest | Content-addressable digest (`sha256:...`) of the container image, when the reference is digest-pinned. |

#### Relationships

- `Function` is connected to the concrete single platform `Image` it actually ran via `RESOLVED_IMAGE`. This edge is produced by the `resolved_image_analysis.json` analysis job and covers container-based functions that expose a container image reference:
    - **AWSLambda** (`PackageType=Image`) has `HAS_IMAGE` on the node itself — `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created directly.
    - **AzureFunctionApp** (`is_container=true`) has `HAS_IMAGE` on the node itself — `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created directly.
    - **GCPCloudRunService** and **GCPCloudRunJob** do NOT carry `:Function`. They are orchestrators (analogous to `ECSService` and AWS Batch). Their per-container specs are materialized as child `GCPCloudRunServiceContainer` / `GCPCloudRunJobContainer` nodes that carry `:Container` and participate in `RESOLVED_IMAGE` via the `:Container` path.
    - When `HAS_IMAGE` points at an `:ImageManifestList`, the determinism guard from the `Container` section applies (single arch-matching child required).
    ```
    (:Function)-[:RESOLVED_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```


### CodeRepository

```{note}
CodeRepository is a semantic label.
```

A code repository represents a source code repository containing software projects and their version history.

| _ont_name | The name of the repository (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_fullname | The full path including namespace (e.g., "org/repo", "group/subgroup/project"). |

| _ont_public | Whether the repository is publicly accessible. |
| _ont_archived | Whether the repository is archived (read-only). |


### NetworkAccessControl

```{note}

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name of the load balancer (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_lb_type | The type of load balancer (e.g., "application", "network", "classic", "Standard", "Basic"). |

| _ont_dns_name | The DNS name or endpoint for the load balancer. |
| _ont_region | The region or location where the load balancer is deployed. |


#### Relationships

- `LoadBalancer` can expose one or many `ComputeInstance` (semantic label):

    ```
- `LoadBalancer` can expose one or many `Container` (semantic label):
    ```
    (:LoadBalancer)-[:EXPOSE]->(:Container)
    ```


### PublicIP

```{note}
PublicIP is an abstract ontology node.
```

A public IP address represents a unique numerical identifier assigned to a device that is routable on the internet.
Public IP addresses can be either IPv4 or IPv6.

```{important}
If field `ip_version` is null, it should not be considered as `4` or `6`, only as unknown.
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | The unique identifier for the IP address (the IP address value itself). |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node. |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated. |
| ip_address | The IP address value (e.g., "203.0.113.1" or "2001:db8::1"). |
| ip_version | Integer indicating the IP version: `4` for IPv4, `6` for IPv6, or `null` if unknown. |

#### Relationships

- `PublicIP` is linked to one or many nodes that represent the IP in a module:
    ```
    (:PublicIP)-[:RESERVED_BY]->(:*)
    ```
- `PublicIP` can point to one or many `LoadBalancer` (semantic label) that use this IP:
    ```
    (:PublicIP)-[:POINTS_TO]->(:LoadBalancer)
    ```
- `PublicIP` can point to one or many `ComputeInstance` (semantic label) that have this IP:
    ```
    (:PublicIP)-[:POINTS_TO]->(:ComputeInstance)
    ```


### Subnet

```{note}
Subnet is a semantic label.
```

A subnet represents an IP subnetwork within a virtual network. It generalizes AWS EC2 subnets, GCP subnetworks, and Azure subnets.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name/identifier of the subnet (REQUIRED). For AWS this is the SubnetId (EC2 subnets have no display name). |
| _ont_cidr_block | The IP range (CIDR) of the subnet. |
| _ont_availability_zone | The availability zone of the subnet. AWS only: GCP subnets are regional and Azure subnets are not zone-scoped, so the field is left unset for those providers. |
| _ont_region | The region/zone where the subnet lives. Not populated for Azure subnets: the region lives on the parent `AzureVirtualNetwork`. A region-scoped cross-cloud query like `MATCH (s:Subnet) WHERE s._ont_region = $region` will silently drop Azure subnets; traverse through `AzureVirtualNetwork` to filter those by region. |

`_ont_is_public` is intentionally not modeled: no provider exposes a faithful public/private flag on the subnet node (it depends on route-table/internet-gateway analysis on AWS, and route/NSG configuration on Azure).

```{note}
Several AWS sync paths (instances, network interfaces, VPC endpoints, auto scaling groups) create partial `EC2Subnet` nodes that know only the subnet id and sometimes the region. These nodes carry the `Subnet` label with `_ont_name` and `_ont_source` set, but may have a null `_ont_cidr_block` / `_ont_availability_zone` until a full subnet sync enriches them. `(:Subnet)` queries that rely on CIDR/AZ should treat absence as "not yet known", not as a real value. GCP subnet stub nodes are deliberately left unlabeled because they lack even a name.
```


### VirtualNetwork

```{note}
VirtualNetwork is a semantic label.
```

A virtual network represents an isolated virtual network environment that defines the network boundary for cloud resources. It generalizes AWS VPCs, GCP VPCs, and Azure virtual networks.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name/identifier of the virtual network (REQUIRED). For AWS this is the VpcId (VPCs have no display name). |
| _ont_cidr | The IP range (CIDR) of the virtual network. AWS only: GCP VPCs keep CIDRs on their subnets, and Azure stores the address space on subnets rather than the virtual network, so the field is left unset for those providers. |
| _ont_region | The region where the virtual network lives. Not populated for GCP (VPCs are global). |


### Package

```{note}
Package is an abstract ontology node.
```

A package represents a software package (library, dependency, or system package) discovered across different scanning tools.
Package nodes are deduplicated by their `id`, which uses the format `{type}|{namespace/}{name}|{version}` for cross-tool matching.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Normalized ID for cross-tool matching (format: `{type}\|{namespace/}{name}\|{version}`). |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node. |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated. |
| name | Name of the package. |
| version | Version of the package. |
| type | Package ecosystem type (e.g., npm, pypi, deb). |

    (:ImageManifestList)-[:CONTAINS_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```


### ImageLayer

```{note}
ImageLayer is a semantic label.
```

An image layer represents an individual filesystem layer within a container image.
Layers are de-duplicated by their content-addressable digest, so multiple images may reference the same layer node.
It generalizes concepts like AWS ECRImageLayer and OCI image layers.
