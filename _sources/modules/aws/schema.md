    ```

- An `AWSPolicy` node is defined for an `AWSAccount`.

    ```cypher
    (:AWSAccount)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSPolicy)
    ```

- `AWSRole` nodes are defined in `AWSAccount` nodes.

    ```cypher
    (:AWSAccount)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSRole)
    ```

- `AWSAccount` nodes can belong to an `AWSOrganizationRoot` or `AWSOrganizationalUnit`.

    ```cypher
    (:AWSAccount)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganizationRoot)
    (:AWSAccount)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganizationalUnit)
    ```

- `AWSOrganizationRoot` and `AWSOrganizationalUnit` nodes can scope organization account placement.

    ```cypher
    (:AWSOrganizationRoot)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSAccount)
    (:AWSOrganizationalUnit)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSAccount)
    ```

Only active AWS Organization accounts receive organization placement relationships and synced AWS account root principals. Suspended or closed organization accounts are still loaded as `AWSAccount` nodes with organization metadata, but they are not attached under the root/OU hierarchy.

### AWSOrganization

Representation of an AWS Organization.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `Tenant` to enable cross-platform queries for organizational tenants across different systems (e.g., OktaOrganization, AzureTenant, GCPOrganization).

|-------|-------------|
|**id**| The AWS Organization ID.|
|arn| The AWS Organization ARN.|
|feature\_set| The feature set of the organization, such as `ALL` or `CONSOLIDATED_BILLING`.|

    ```cypher
    (:AWSOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSOrganizationRoot)
    (:AWSOrganizationRoot)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganization)
    ```

Cartography only cleans up AWS Organizations hierarchy data after it successfully enumerates the complete organization hierarchy. If the Organizations API is unavailable, access is denied, or hierarchy enumeration is incomplete, Cartography skips Organizations cleanup to preserve the prior hierarchy. `AWSAccount` nodes and their account-scoped resources are preserved when accounts move, leave the organization, or become inactive; Organizations cleanup only updates stale placement metadata, roots, OUs, and hierarchy relationships.

### AWSOrganizationRoot

Representation of an AWS Organizations root.

| Field | Description |

    ```cypher
    (:AWSOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSOrganizationRoot)
    (:AWSOrganizationRoot)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganization)
    ```

- `AWSOrganizationRoot` nodes can contain AWS accounts and organizational units.

    ```cypher
    (:AWSOrganizationRoot)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSAccount)
    (:AWSOrganizationRoot)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSOrganizationalUnit)
    (:AWSAccount)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganizationRoot)
    (:AWSOrganizationalUnit)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganizationRoot)
    ```

### AWSOrganizationalUnit

|parent\_ou\_id| The Cartography parent organizational unit ID, when the organizational unit is nested under another organizational unit.|
|lastupdated| Timestamp of the last time the node was updated.|

#### Relationships

- `AWSOrganizationalUnit` nodes can be nested under roots or other OUs.

    ```cypher
    (:AWSOrganizationRoot)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSOrganizationalUnit)
    (:AWSOrganizationalUnit)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSOrganizationalUnit)
    (:AWSOrganizationalUnit)-[:PARENT]->(:AWSOrganizationRoot)

### ECRRepositoryImage

An ECR image may be referenced and tagged by more than one ECR Repository. To best represent this, we've created an
`ECRRepositoryImage` node as a layer of indirection between the repo and the image.

More concretely explained, we run
[`ecr.list_images()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_ImageIdentifier.html), and then
store the image tag on an `ECRRepositoryImage` node and the image digest hash on a separate `ECRImage` node.

This way, more than one `ECRRepositoryImage` can reference/be connected to the same `ECRImage`.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `ImageTag` to enable cross-platform queries for image tags across different container registries.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| tag | The tag applied to the repository image, e.g. "latest" |
| uri | The URI where the repository image is stored |
| **id** | same as uri |
| image_size_bytes | The size of the image in bytes |
| image_pushed_at | The date and time the image was pushed to the repository |
| image_manifest_media_type | The media type of the image manifest, see [opencontainers image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/media-types.md) |
| artifact_media_type | The media type of the image artifact |
| last_recorded_pull_time | The date and time the image was last pulled |

#### Relationships

- An ECRRepository contains ECRRepositoryImages:
    ```
    (:ECRRepository)-[:REPO_IMAGE]->(:ECRRepositoryImage)
    ```

- ECRRepositoryImages reference ECRImages
    ```
    (:ECRRepositoryImage)-[:IMAGE]->(:ECRImage)
    ```

- ECRRepositoryImages may be packaged from a source repository (cross-module relationship via VCS modules)
    ```
    (:ECRRepositoryImage)-[:PACKAGED_FROM]->(:GitHubRepository)
    ```

    Relationship properties:
    - **dockerfile_path**: Path to the Dockerfile in the repository
    - **confidence**: Confidence score of the match (0.0 to 1.0)
    - **matched_commands**: Number of commands that matched
    - **total_commands**: Total number of commands compared
    - **command_similarity**: Average similarity score

    This relationship links all images in an ECR repository to the source VCS repository via `repo_uri` matching.


### ECRImage

Representation of an ECR image identified by its digest (e.g. a SHA hash). Specifically, this is the "digest part" of
[`ecr.list_images()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_ImageIdentifier.html). Also see
ECRRepositoryImage.

For multi-architecture images, Cartography creates ECRImage nodes for the manifest list, each platform-specific image, and any attestations.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has conditional extra labels based on the `type` field: `Image` (when type="image"), `ImageAttestation` (when type="attestation"), or `ImageManifestList` (when type="manifest_list"). This enables cross-platform queries for container images across different registries.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Same as digest |
| **digest** | The hash of this ECR image |
| region | The AWS region |
| layer_diff_ids | Ordered list of image layer digests for this image. Only set for `type="image"` nodes. `null` for manifest lists and attestations. |
| type | Type of image: `"image"` (platform-specific or single-arch image), `"manifest_list"` (multi-arch index), or `"attestation"` (attestation manifest) |
| architecture | CPU architecture (e.g., `"amd64"`, `"arm64"`). Set to `"unknown"` for attestations, `null` for manifest lists. |
| os | Operating system (e.g., `"linux"`, `"windows"`). Set to `"unknown"` for attestations, `null` for manifest lists. |
| variant | Architecture variant (e.g., `"v8"` for ARM). Optional field. |
| attestation_type | For attestations only: the type of attestation (e.g., `"attestation-manifest"`). `null` for regular images. |
| attests_digest | For attestations only: the digest of the image this attestation is for. `null` for regular images. |
| media_type | The OCI/Docker media type of this manifest (e.g., `"application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json"`) |
| artifact_media_type | The artifact media type if this is an OCI artifact. Optional field. |
| child_image_digests | For manifest lists only: list of platform-specific image digests contained in this manifest list. Excludes attestations. `null` for regular images and attestations. |
| **source_uri** | Source repository URI extracted from SLSA provenance attestations (e.g., a GitLab project URL or GitHub repo URL). Indexed for cross-module matching. |
| source_revision | Source commit revision from SLSA provenance attestations. |
| **invocation_uri** | CI/CD invocation URI from SLSA provenance (e.g., GitHub repository URL). Indexed for cross-module matching. |
| **invocation_workflow** | CI/CD workflow path from SLSA provenance (e.g., `.github/workflows/build.yml`). Indexed for cross-module matching. |
| invocation_run_number | CI/CD run number from SLSA provenance (e.g., the GitHub Actions run number). |
| source_file | Dockerfile path from SLSA provenance (`configSource.entryPoint` prefixed with `vcs localdir:dockerfile` if present). |

    - `from_attestation`: Boolean flag indicating the relationship was derived from provenance attestation (always `true`)
    - `confidence`: Confidence level of the relationship (always `"explicit"` for attestation-based relationships)

- A manifest list ECRImage contains platform-specific ECRImages (only applies to `type="manifest_list"` nodes)
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "manifest_list"})-[:CONTAINS_IMAGE]->(:ECRImage {type: "image"})
    ```

- An attestation ECRImage attests/validates another ECRImage (only applies to `type="attestation"` nodes)
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "attestation"})-[:ATTESTS]->(:ECRImage)
    ```

- An ECRImage may be packaged by a GitHubWorkflow (derived from SLSA provenance attestations). Only applies to `type="image"` nodes with the `Image` semantic label.
    ```
    (:ECRImage:Image)-[:PACKAGED_BY]->(:GitHubWorkflow)
    ```

    Note: This cross-module relationship is created when SLSA provenance attestations specify the GitHub Actions workflow that built the container image. See the [GitHub schema](../github/schema.md#githubworkflow) for more details on GitHubWorkflow nodes.


### ECRImageLayer

Representation of an individual Docker image layer discovered while processing ECR manifests. Layers are de-duplicated by `diff_id`, so multiple images (or multiple points within the same image) may reference the same `ECRImageLayer` node. Note that `diff_id` is the **uncompressed** (DiffID) SHA-256 of the layer tar stream. Docker's canonical empty layer therefore always appears as `sha256:5f70bf18a086007016e948b04aed3b82103a36bea41755b6cddfaf10ace3c6ef` and is marked with `is_empty = true`. (If you inspect registry manifests you may see the compressed blob digest `sha256:a3ed95ca...`, both refer to the same empty layer.)

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `ImageLayer` to enable cross-platform queries for image layers across different container registries.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Same as `diff_id` |
| diff_id | Digest of the layer |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| is_empty | Boolean flag identifying Docker's empty layer (true when the **DiffID** is `sha256:5f70bf18...`). |
| history | The `created_by` command from the image config that created this layer (e.g., `/bin/sh -c pip install flask`). Used for Dockerfile matching. |

#### Relationships

- Image layers belong to an AWSAccount
    ```
    (:ECRImageLayer)<-[:RESOURCE]-(:AWSAccount)
    ```

- Layers point to the next layer in the manifest
    ```
    (:ECRImageLayer)-[:NEXT]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

- A layer can be the head of a platform-specific image (only `type="image"` nodes have layer relationships)
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "image"})-[:HEAD]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

- A layer can be the tail of a platform-specific image
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "image"})-[:TAIL]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

- Platform-specific images reference all of their layers
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "image"})-[:HAS_LAYER]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

#### Query Examples

- List the ordered layers for a specific image directly from graph relationships:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (img:ECRImage {digest: $digest})-[:HEAD]->(head:ECRImageLayer)
    MATCH (img)-[:TAIL]->(tail:ECRImageLayer)
    MATCH path = (head)-[:NEXT*0..]->(tail)
    WHERE ALL(layer IN nodes(path) WHERE (img)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(layer))
    WITH path
    ORDER BY length(path) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    UNWIND range(0, length(path)) AS idx
    RETURN idx AS position, nodes(path)[idx].diff_id AS diff_id
    ORDER BY position;
    ```

- Use the stored manifest order when you only need the digests:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (img:ECRImage {digest: $digest})
    UNWIND range(0, size(img.layer_diff_ids) - 1) AS idx
    RETURN idx AS position, img.layer_diff_ids[idx] AS diff_id
    ORDER BY position;
    ```

- Detect images whose layer chains diverge (typically because the Docker empty layer is repeated):
    ```cypher
    MATCH (img:ECRImage)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(layer:ECRImageLayer)
    MATCH (layer)-[:NEXT]->(child:ECRImageLayer)
    WHERE (img)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(child)
    WITH img, layer, collect(DISTINCT child.diff_id) AS next_diff_ids
    WHERE size(next_diff_ids) > 1
    RETURN img.digest AS digest,
           layer.diff_id AS branching_layer,
           next_diff_ids AS successors
    ORDER BY digest, branching_layer;
    ```
- Find parent image given a digest (need to specify base image repository):
    ```cypher
    WITH $target_digest as target_digest
    // Get target image's layer chain via graph traversal
    MATCH (target:ECRImage {digest: target_digest})
    MATCH (target)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(tl:ECRImageLayer)
    WITH target, collect(id(tl)) AS targetAllowedIds
    CALL {
    WITH target, targetAllowedIds
    MATCH p = (target)-[:HEAD]->(:ECRImageLayer)-[:NEXT*0..]->(:ECRImageLayer)<-[:TAIL]-(target)
    WITH p, targetAllowedIds, [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | id(n)] AS layerIds
    WHERE all(i IN layerIds WHERE i IN targetAllowedIds)
    RETURN [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | n.diff_id] AS target_diff_ids
    ORDER BY length(p) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    }
    // Get all base images with their layer chains from a repo called 'base-images'
    MATCH (base_repo:ECRRepository {name: 'base-images'})-[:REPO_IMAGE]->(base_img:ECRRepositoryImage)-[:IMAGE]->(base:ECRImage)
    MATCH (base)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(bl:ECRImageLayer)
    WITH target_diff_ids, base, base_img, collect(id(bl)) AS baseAllowedIds
    CALL {
    WITH base, baseAllowedIds
    MATCH p = (base)-[:HEAD]->(:ECRImageLayer)-[:NEXT*0..]->(:ECRImageLayer)<-[:TAIL]-(base)
    WITH p, baseAllowedIds, [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | id(n)] AS layerIds
    WHERE all(i IN layerIds WHERE i IN baseAllowedIds)
    RETURN [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | n.diff_id] AS base_diff_ids
    ORDER BY length(p) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    }
    // Calculate longest common prefix
    WITH target_diff_ids, base, base_img, base_diff_ids,
        REDUCE(lcp = 0, i IN RANGE(0, SIZE(base_diff_ids)-1) |
        CASE WHEN i < SIZE(target_diff_ids) AND base_diff_ids[i] = target_diff_ids[i]
                THEN lcp + 1 ELSE lcp END
        ) as lcp_length
    // Only keep matches where ALL base layers match (complete prefix)
    WHERE lcp_length = SIZE(base_diff_ids)
    RETURN base.digest, base_img.uri, base_img.tag, base_img.image_pushed_at,
        SIZE(base_diff_ids) as base_layer_count, lcp_length
    ORDER BY lcp_length DESC, base_img.image_pushed_at DESC
    LIMIT 1

### NetworkInterface

Representation of a generic Network Interface.  Currently however, we only create NetworkInterface nodes from AWS [EC2 Instances](#ec2instance).  The spec for an AWS EC2 network interface is [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_InstanceNetworkInterface.html).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| firstseen| Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node  |
| lastupdated |  Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The ID of the network interface.  (known as `networkInterfaceId` in EC2) |
| **mac\_address**| The MAC address of the network interface|
| **private\_ip\_address**| The primary IPv4 address of the network interface within the subnet |
| description |  Description of the network interface|
| private\_dns\_name| The private DNS name |
| region | The AWS region |
| status | Status of the network interface.  Valid Values: ``available \| associated \| attaching \| in-use \| detaching `` |
| **subnetid** | The ID of the subnet |
| **subnet_id** | The ID of the subnet |
| interface_type  |  Describes the type of network interface. Valid values: `` interface \| efa `` |
| **requester_id**  | Id of the requester, e.g. `amazon-elb` for ELBs |
| requester_managed  |  Indicates whether the interface is managed by the requester |
| source_dest_check   | Indicates whether to validate network traffic to or from this network interface.  |
| **public_ip**   | Public IPv4 address attached to the interface  |
| attach_time | The timestamp when the network interface was attached to an EC2 instance. For primary interfaces (device_index=0), this reveals the first launch time of the instance [according to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Instance.html). |
| device_index | The index of the device on the instance for the network interface attachment. A value of `0` indicates the primary (eth0) network interface, which is created when the instance is launched. |

#### Usage Notes

**Finding the True First Launch Time:**

The `LaunchTime` field on EC2Instance nodes shows the *last* launch time (e.g., if an instance was stopped and restarted). To find when an instance was *originally* created, use the `attach_time` of the primary network interface (`device_index: 0`):

```cypher
// Get the true first launch time for EC2 instances
MATCH (i:EC2Instance)-[:NETWORK_INTERFACE]->(ni:NetworkInterface {device_index: 0})
WHERE ni.attach_time IS NOT NULL
RETURN i.instanceid, i.launchtime as last_launch, ni.attach_time as first_launch
```

**Primary vs Secondary Interfaces:**
- **Primary interfaces** (`device_index: 0`): Created when the instance is launched, cannot be detached. The `attach_time` represents the instance's original creation time.
- **Secondary interfaces** (`device_index: 1+`): Can be attached and detached at any time. The `attach_time` represents when the secondary interface was attached, not when the instance was created.

#### Relationships

| **reader\_endpoint** | The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint. |

### AWSSSOUser

Representation of an AWS SSO User.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `UserAccount` to enable cross-platform queries for user accounts across different systems (e.g., OktaUser, EntraUser, GitHubUser).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Unique identifier for the SSO user |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| user_name | The username of the SSO user |
| **external_id** | The external ID of the SSO user |
| identity_store_id | The identity store ID of the SSO user |
| region | The AWS region |

#### Relationships
- AWSSSOUser is part of an AWSAccount.
    ```
    (:AWSAccount)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```

- An AWSSSOUser can be a member of one or more AWSSSOGroups. In effect, the AWSSSOUser will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(:AWSSSOGroup)
    ```

- AWSSSOUsers can be assigned to AWSRoles. This happens when the user is assigned to a permission set for a specific account. This includes both direct assignments to the user and assignments inherited through AWSSSOGroup membership. Note: The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `ALLOWED_BY` relationships for roles they can access through groups they belong to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)<-[:ALLOWED_BY]-(:AWSRole)
    ```

- OktaUsers can assume AWS SSO users via SAML federation
     ```
    (:OktaUser)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```
    More generically, user accounts can assume AWS SSO users via SAML federation.
    ```
    (:UserAccount)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```

- An AWSSSOUser can be assigned to one or more AWSPermissionSets. This includes both direct assignments and assignments inherited through AWSSSOGroup membership.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Notes:
    - The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `HAS_ROLE` relationships for permission sets they have access to through groups they belong to. This means if a user is only in a group that has a permission set assignment, the user will still have a direct `HAS_ROLE` relationship to that permission set.
    - This is a **summary relationship** that does not indicate which specific accounts the user has access to, only that they have been assigned to the permission set. For a user to have access to an AWS account, they must be assigned to a permission set for that specific account. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.

- AWSSSOUser can assume AWS roles via SAML (recorded from CloudTrail management events).
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:ASSUMED_ROLE_WITH_SAML {times_used, first_seen_in_time_window, last_used, lastupdated}]->(:AWSRole)
    ```
    This relationship is created by analyzing CloudTrail `AssumeRoleWithSAML` events. The relationship properties track:
    - `times_used`: Number of times the role was assumed during the lookback window
    - `first_seen_in_time_window`: Earliest assumption time in the lookback window
    - `last_used`: Most recent assumption time
    - `lastupdated`: When this relationship was last updated by Cartography

    Note: This relationship represents **actual role usage** (what roles were assumed), while `ALLOWED_BY` represents **permitted access** (what roles can be assumed based on permission set assignments).

- Entra users can sign on to AWSSSOUser via SAML federation through AWS Identity Center. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/idp-microsoft-entra.html and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/aws-single-sign-on-tutorial.

### AWSSSOGroup

Representation of an AWS SSO Group.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `UserGroup` to enable cross-platform queries for user groups across different systems (e.g., AWSGroup, EntraGroup, GoogleWorkspaceGroup).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Unique identifier for the SSO group |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| display_name | The display name of the SSO group |
| description | The description of the SSO group |
| **external_id** | The external ID of the SSO group |
| identity_store_id | The identity store ID of the SSO group |
| region | The AWS region |

#### Relationships
- AWSSSOGroup is part of an AWSAccount.
    ```
    (:AWSAccount)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSSSOGroup)
    ```

- An AWSSSOGroup can have roles assigned. This happens if the group is assigned to a permission set for a specific account.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOGroup)<-[:ALLOWED_BY]-(:AWSRole)
    ```

- An AWSSSOGroup has assigned permission sets. AWSSSOUsers in the group will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOGroup)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Notes:
    - This relationship does not indicate which accounts the group has access to, only that it has been assigned to the permission set. For a group to have access to an AWS account, it must be assigned to a permission set for that specific account. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.
    - The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationships for permission sets they have access to through groups they belong to. This means if a user is only in a group that has a permission set assignment, the user will still have a direct `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationship to that permission set.

- AWSSSOUsers can be members of AWSSSOGroups. In effect, the AWSSSOUser will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(:AWSSSOGroup)
    ```

### AWSPermissionSet

Representation of an AWS Identity Center Permission Set.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `PermissionRole` to enable cross-platform queries for IAM roles and permission roles across different systems (e.g., AWSRole, AzureRoleDefinition, GCPRole, KubernetesRole).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Unique identifier for the Permission Set |

| arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Permission Set |
| description | The description of the Permission Set |
| session_duration | The session duration of the Permission Set |
| instance_arn | The ARN of the Identity Center instance the Permission Set belongs to |
| region | The AWS region where the Permission Set is located |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |

#### Relationships
- An AWSPermissionSet is part of an AWSIdentityCenter instance.
    ```
    (:AWSIdentityCenter)-[:HAS_PERMISSION_SET]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```

- An AWSPermissionSet creates AWSRoles in all of the AWS accounts that its associated permission set assigns it to.
    ```
    (:AWSPermissionSet)-[:ASSIGNED_TO_ROLE]->(:AWSRole)
    ```

- An AWSSSOUser can be assigned to one or more AWSPermissionSets. This includes both direct assignments and assignments inherited through AWSSSOGroup membership.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Notes:
    - The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `HAS_ROLE` relationships for permission sets they have access to through groups they belong to. This means if a user is only in a group that has a permission set assignment, the user will still have a direct `HAS_ROLE` relationship to that permission set.
    - This is a **summary relationship** that does not indicate which specific accounts the user has access to, only that they have been assigned to the permission set. For a user to have access to an AWS account, they must be assigned to a permission set _for that specific account_. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.

- An AWSSSOGroup has assigned permission sets. AWSSSOUsers in the group will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOGroup)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Note: This relationship does not indicate which accounts the group has access to, only that it has been assigned to the permission set. For a group to have access to an AWS account, it must be assigned to a permission set for that specific account. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.

#### Relationships

- CloudFormation Stack is a resource under an AWS Account

    ```

- CloudFormation Stack uses an IAM Role for execution (if configured)
    ```
    (CloudFormationStack)-[:HAS_EXECUTION_ROLE]->(AWSRole)
    ```

- An AWS Principal can escalate privileges via CloudFormation
    ```
    (AWSPrincipal)-[:CAN_EXEC]->(CloudFormationStack)
    ```
    **Note:** This edge is created for any principal with `cloudformation:UpdateStack` permission on a stack. However, true privilege escalation only occurs when the target stack has a service role (`role_arn` is set), because stacks without a service role execute with the caller's own permissions. Downstream consumers should filter on `role_arn IS NOT NULL` for high-confidence escalation paths.
