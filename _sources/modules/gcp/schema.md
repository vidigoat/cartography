### Tag::Label::GCPLabel

Representation of a GCP [Label](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/labels-overview). GCP Labels can be applied to many resource types. This is a unified label node type similar to how `AWSTag` works for AWS resources.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra labels `Tag` and `Label` to preserve cross-platform semantics for generic key/value labels. `(:Tag {key, value})` matches GCP labels alongside AWS, Azure, and Tenable tags.

Each resource type has its own declarative schema (e.g., `GCPBucketGCPLabelSchema` and `GCPInstanceGCPLabelSchema`). Bucket-sourced labels also carry the `GCPBucketLabel` extra label for backward compatibility with the legacy per-resource label schema.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                 |

| id            | The ID of the label. Takes the form `{resource_id}:{key}:{value}`.                                         |
| key           | The key of the label.                                                                                       |
| value         | The value of the label.                                                                                     |
| resource_type | The Cartography node label of the resource this label is attached to (e.g. `GCPBucket`, `GCPInstance`).     |

#### Relationships

- GCP resources are linked to their GCPLabels via `:TAGGED` (canonical, matches the cross-provider tag pattern). The legacy `:LABELED` edge is still written in parallel and will be removed in v1.0.0.

    ```
    (GCPBucket)-[TAGGED]->(GCPLabel:GCPBucketLabel)
    (GCPInstance)-[TAGGED]->(GCPLabel)
    ```

- GCPLabel nodes are associated with a GCPProject via the RESOURCE relationship.

    ```
    (GCPProject)-[RESOURCE]->(GCPLabel)
    ```

    ```

- GCPNetworkInterfaces are attached to GCPInstances

    ```

    ```

- GCP Instances may have GCP Tags defined on them for use in [network firewall routing](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/labelling-and-grouping-your-google-cloud-platform-resources).

    ```

- GCPBackendServices expose GCPInstances. Created by the `gcp_lb_exposure` scoped analysis job when the backend service is external-facing.
    ```
    (GCPBackendService)-[:EXPOSE]->(GCPInstance)
    ```

### GCPRole

Representation of a GCP [Role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles).

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `PermissionRole` to enable cross-platform queries for IAM roles and permission roles across different systems (e.g., AWSRole, AzureRoleDefinition, GCPRole, KubernetesRole).

- **Custom organization roles** (`organizations/*/roles/*`) - Custom roles defined at the organization level
- **Custom project roles** (`projects/*/roles/*`) - Custom roles defined at the project level

**Important**: Organization-level roles (predefined + custom org) and project-level roles (custom project) have different sub-resource relationships:
- Organization-level roles are sub-resources of `GCPOrganization`
- Project-level roles are sub-resources of `GCPProject`

### GCPPolicyBinding

| Field                | Description                                                                      |

| members              | A list of principal email addresses that are granted the role. The synthetic GCP principals `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` are NOT included here; presence of either is reflected in `is_public` instead. |

#### Relationships

- GCPPolicyBindings are resources of the scope where the binding is attached.
  Project and child-resource bindings are owned by GCPProjects. Inherited
  organization and folder bindings are owned by GCPOrganizations and GCPFolders,
  respectively. Queries that need inherited bindings should traverse the
  binding's owner scope or its `APPLIES_TO` edge.

    ```
    (GCPProject)-[:RESOURCE]->(GCPPolicyBinding)
    (GCPOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GCPPolicyBinding)
    (GCPFolder)-[:RESOURCE]->(GCPPolicyBinding)
    ```

- GCPPrincipals have allow policies that grant them access.

    ```
    (GCPPrincipal)-[:HAS_ALLOW_POLICY]->(GCPPolicyBinding)
    ```

- Workload Identity Federation pools have allow policies that grant federated
  principals access. The edge is created when a binding member is a `principal://`
  or `principalSet://` URI referencing the pool.

    ```
    (GCPWorkloadIdentityPool)-[:HAS_ALLOW_POLICY]->(GCPPolicyBinding)
    ```

- GCPPolicyBindings grant roles to principals.

    ```
    (GCPPolicyBinding)-[:GRANTS_ROLE]->(GCPRole)
    ```

- GCPPolicyBindings apply to the concrete resource they govern. The edge is
  created only when the bound resource is already present in the graph, and
  supports `GCPProject`, `GCPFolder`, `GCPOrganization`, `GCPBucket`,
  `GCPKeyRing`, `GCPCryptoKey`, `GCPSecretManagerSecret`,
  `GCPSecretManagerSecretVersion`, `GCPArtifactRegistryRepository`,
  `GCPCloudRunService`, `GCPInstance`, `GCPVpc`, `GCPSubnet`, and
  `GCPFirewall` targets.

### Cloud Run Resources

#### Overview

Google Cloud Run is a serverless compute platform for running containers. Cartography ingests the following Cloud Run resources:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Project[GCPProject]
    Service[GCPCloudRunService]
    Revision[GCPCloudRunRevision]
    Job[GCPCloudRunJob]
    Execution[GCPCloudRunExecution]
    ServiceAccount[GCPServiceAccount]

    Project -->|RESOURCE| Service
    Project -->|RESOURCE| Revision
    Project -->|RESOURCE| Job
    Project -->|RESOURCE| Execution

    Service -->|HAS_REVISION| Revision
    Job -->|HAS_EXECUTION| Execution

    Service -->|RUNS_AS| ServiceAccount
    Revision -->|USES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT| ServiceAccount
    Job -->|RUNS_AS| ServiceAccount
```

### GCPCloudRunService

Representation of a GCP [Cloud Run Service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.services).

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `ComputeService` to enable cross-platform queries for compute orchestrators across different systems (e.g., `ECSService`, `GCPCloudRunJob`). Its child `GCPCloudRunServiceContainer` nodes carry `:Container` and `HAS_IMAGE`.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated| Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Full resource name of the service (e.g., `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/services/{service}`) |
| name | Short name of the service |
| location | The GCP location where the service is deployed |
| description | User-provided description of the service |
| uri | Default URL serving the service |
| latest_ready_revision | Full resource name of the latest ready revision for this service |
| service_account_email | The email of the service account configured on the service template (used by new revisions created from this service) |
| ingress | The ingress setting for the service. Values: `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL`, `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_ONLY`, `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER`, `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_NONE`. |
| exposed_internet | Set to `true` if `ingress` is `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL`. Set to `false` if `ingress` is `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_ONLY` or `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_NONE`. Other values are currently left unset because they may still be internet-reachable via load balancers. |
| exposed_internet_type | Set to `'direct'` when the service allows all ingress traffic. |

Cloud Run Service is treated as an orchestrator (analogous to `ECSService`) and carries the `:ComputeService` semantic label. The container specs from the `latestReadyRevision` (returned inline in `service.template.containers`) are materialized as child `GCPCloudRunServiceContainer` nodes that carry `:Container` and `HAS_IMAGE`. Older revisions are tracked as pure metadata via `GCPCloudRunRevision`, with no image data attached.

#### Relationships

  - GCPCloudRunServices are resources of GCPProjects.
    ```
    (GCPProject)-[:RESOURCE]->(GCPCloudRunService)
    ```
  - GCPCloudRunServices have GCPCloudRunRevisions.
    ```
    (GCPCloudRunService)-[:HAS_REVISION]->(GCPCloudRunRevision)
