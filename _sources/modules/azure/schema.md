### AzureSQLServerFirewallRule :: IpPermissionInbound :: IpRule

Representation of an [AzureSQLServerFirewallRule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/sql/firewall-rules).

Two distinct cases are worth calling out and should NOT be conflated by downstream rules:

- **Public-internet exposure**: a rule whose range covers public IP space (for example `start_ip_address = 0.0.0.0` / `end_ip_address = 255.255.255.255`, or any rule whose range overlaps the public internet) lets arbitrary clients on the public internet reach the server.
- **Allow Azure services**: the special `start_ip_address = 0.0.0.0` / `end_ip_address = 0.0.0.0` row (also exposed via the SQL Server's `public_network_access` + the "Allow Azure services and resources to access this server" toggle) allows traffic from Azure-hosted services / resources only, not arbitrary public IPs. It is a different exposure class and should be flagged separately.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `Container` to enable cross-platform queries across container runtimes (e.g., KubernetesContainer, ECSContainer).
> **Note**: ACI does not expose host architecture via its API; all workloads are assumed to run on `amd64`. `HAS_IMAGE` resolves only when the image is referenced by digest (`image@sha256:...`); tag-based references produce no relationship.

| architecture_normalized | Canonical CPU architecture. Hardcoded to `amd64` |
