## Semgrep Schema

### SemgrepDeployment

Represents a Semgrep [Deployment](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/Deployment), a unit encapsulating a security organization inside Semgrep Cloud. Works as the parent of all other Semgrep resources.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node  |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Unique integer id representing the deployment |
| **slug** | Lowercase string id representing the deployment to query the API |
| **name** | Name of security organization connected to the deployment |

### SemgrepSASTFinding::SecurityIssue

Represents a [Semgrep SAST](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-code/getting-started/) finding. This is a code-level security issue discovered either from the Semgrep Cloud Platform or from OSS Semgrep CLI JSON reports ingested via `--semgrep-oss-source`. Cloud findings come from the Semgrep Findings API. OSS findings come from explicit Semgrep OSS JSON report artifacts described in a repository mapping file passed to `--semgrep-oss-source`.

>> **Note**: The OSS Semgrep JSON report does not include repository identity. Cartography therefore requires `--semgrep-oss-source` to point to a repository mapping YAML file. See more in the [Semgrep config](./config.md#oss-semgrep-configuration)


>
> To create `FOUND_IN` relationships for OSS findings, matching `GitHubRepository` (for `provider: github` entries) or `GitLabProject` (for `provider: gitlab` entries) nodes must already exist in the graph. `GitHubRepository` nodes are matched by `id` equal to the repository `url` declared in the mapping file; `GitLabProject` nodes are matched by `web_url`. If the repository nodes are absent, Cartography still ingests the `SemgrepSASTFinding` nodes but cannot attach them.

> **Cloud-only fields**: `line_of_code_url`, `state`, `fix_status`, `triage_status`, `opened_at`, `risk_severity`, and the `HAS_ASSISTANT` relationship are only populated for Semgrep Cloud findings.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `SecurityIssue` to enable cross-scanner queries for non-CVE security issues across different tools (e.g., GuardDutyFinding, SemgrepSecretsFinding, AzureSecurityAssessment).

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Unique integer id from Semgrep Cloud, or for OSS findings a synthetic id prefixed with `semgrep-oss-sast-`. OSS IDs prefer Semgrep's `extra.fingerprint` when present, but ignore unusable placeholder values such as `requires login`; in those cases Cartography falls back to a SHA-256 hash of `check_id`, `path`, start/end location, and `repository_url`. |

| triage_status | Triage status of the finding (e.g. untriaged, ignored, reopened). Cloud only |
| opened_at | Date and time when the finding was first seen in UTC. Cloud only |
| risk_severity | Risk level computed by post-ingestion analysis. INFO for archived repos, otherwise equals severity. See [semgrep_sast_risk_analysis.json](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/cartography/data/jobs/scoped_analysis/semgrep_sast_risk_analysis.json) for further details.
